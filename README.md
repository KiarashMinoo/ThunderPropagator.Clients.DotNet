## Installation

### Step 1: Add the Custom NuGet Repository
To install the libraries as NuGet packages, you need to add the custom NuGet repository to your NuGet configuration.

#### Using Visual Studio:
1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Go to **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Settings**.
3. Under **Package Sources**, click the **+** button to add a new source.
4. Enter the following details:
  - **Name**: `ThunderPropagator`
  - **Source**: `https://nuget.thunderpropagator.com/v3/index.json`
5. Click **Update** and then **OK**.

#### Using the Command Line:
Add the NuGet source using the following command:
```bash
dotnet nuget add source --name ThunderPropagator --source https://nuget.thunderpropagator.com/v3/index.json
```

#### Create or Update `nuget.config`
If you don’t already have a `nuget.config` file in your project or solution directory, create one. If you do, update it to include the custom repository.

Here’s an example of what the `nuget.config` file should look like:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <!-- Add the official NuGet.org source -->
    <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
    <!-- Add the custom ThunderPropagator NuGet repository -->
    <add key="ThunderPropagator" value="https://nuget.thunderpropagator.com/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

Place the `nuget.config` file in the root of your solution or project directory. This ensures that all projects in the solution can access the custom NuGet repository.

### Step 2: Verify the Configuration

To verify that the custom repository is correctly configured, you can use the following command in the terminal:
```bash
dotnet nuget list source
```
This will list all configured NuGet sources. You should see something like this in the output:
```text
Registered Sources:
  1.  nuget.org [Enabled]
      https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
  2.  ThunderPropagator [Enabled]
      https://nuget.thunderpropagator.com/v3/index.json
```

### Step 3: Install the NuGet Packages
You can now install the packages using the following commands:

```bash
dotnet add package ThunderPropagator.Clients.DotNet
```

Alternatively, you can install the packages via the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.
